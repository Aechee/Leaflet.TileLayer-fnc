# Leaflet.TileLayer-fnc

Plugin for [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) adding a dynamic, versatile URL-generating capability to [`L.TileLayer`](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.2.0.html#tilelayer) allowing a callback function instead of a URL template string.

Compatible with Leaflet version 1.0 (tested with 1.2.0), **not** compatible with version 0.x.

See [demo](https://kluizeberg.github.io/Leaflet.TileLayer-fnc/demo.html) (WMS layer tiles are randomly switched).

## Installation and usage

P.m.

See also [`demo.html`](demo.html).
## API

This plugin alters Leaflet's class `L.TileLayer` and adds 2 static function factories to it as well as a utility function to the `L` namespace.
